Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?
Last week I went to the theatre.
I had a very good seat.
The play was very interesting.Idid not enjoy it.
A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
They were talking loudly.
I got very angry.I could not hear the actors.
I turned round.I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
They did not pay any attention.
In the end,I could not bear it.
I turned round again &apos;I can&apos;t hear a word!&apos;I said angrily
&apos;It&apos;s none of your business,&apos;the young man said rudely.
&apos;This is a private conversation!&apos;

&apos;What a day!&apos;I thought. &apos;It&apos;s raining again.&apos;
Just then,the telephone rang.It was my aunt Lucy.
&apos;I&apos;ve just arrived by train,&apos; she said.&apos;I&apos;m coming to see you.&apos;
&apos;But I&apos;m still having breakfast,&apos;I said. &apos;What are you doing? she asked.
&apos;I&apos;m having breakfast,&apos;I repeated.

Lesson 3
Please send me a card
First listen and then answer the question:
How many cards did the writer send?
Postcards always spoil my holidays.
Last summer,I went to Italy.I visited museums and sat in public gardens.
A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian.Then he lent me a book.
I read a few lines,but I did not understand a word.
Every day I thought about postcards.
My holidays passed quickly,but I did not send cards to my friends.
On the last day I made a big decision.I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards.
I spent the whole day in my room,but I did not write a single card!

I gave him a meal.He ate the food and drank the beer.
Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.
Later a neighbour told me about him.Everybody knows him.His name is Percy Buttons.

Bill Frith&apos;s garden is larger than Joe&apos;s.
Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables
but Joe&apos;s garden is more interesting.
He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.

Apart from a few words,I do not know any French at all.
Neither of us spoke during the journey.
I had nearly reached the town,when the young man suddenly said,very slowly,
&apos;Do you speak English?&apos;
As I soon learnt,he was English himself!

Instead of catching fish,they catch old boots and rubbish.
I am even less luckyI never catch anything--not even old boots.
After having spent whole mornings on the river,I always go home with an empty bag.
&apos;You must give up fishing!&apos; my friends say.&apos;It&apos;s a waste of time.&apos;
But they don&apos;t realize one important thing.
I&apos;m not really interested in fishing.

Of course,many pictures are not &apos;about&apos; anything
They are just pretty patterns.
We like them in the same way that we like pretty curtain material.

They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and hurried outside.
It was raining heavily and they found that a stream had formed in the field.

Captain Fawcett&apos;s first passenger was a doctor
who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains.
Since then,Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places.
Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats

Lesson 30
 Football or polo?
First listen and then answer the question:
What happened to the man in the boat?
The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home.
I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons
It was warm last Sunday,so I went and sat on the river bank as usual.
Some children were playing games on the bank
and there were some people rowing on the river
Suddenly,one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat
Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat,
but he did not hear them.
The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.
I turned to look at the children,but there weren&apos;t any in sight:
they had all run away!
The man laughed when he realized what had happened.
He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.

   Success story
First listen and then answer the question:
What was Frank&apos;s first job?
Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me
about his experiences as a young man.
Before he retired,Frank was the head of a very large business company,
but as a boy he used to work in a small shop.
It was his job to repair bicycles
and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day.
He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own.
In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes.
At that time he had two helpers
In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory
which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people.
Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years 
and the long road to success.
He was still smiling when the door opened
and his wife came in 
She wanted him to repair their grandson&apos;s bicycle!

Lesson 32
 Shopping made easy
First listen and then answer the question:
Who was the thief?
People are not so honest as they once were.
The temptation to steal is greater than ever before-
especially in large shops.
A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman
who always went into a large store on Monday mornings
One Monday,there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in,
so it was easier for the detective to watch her.
The woman first bought a few small articles.
After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop
and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as
quickly as possible.
Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying.
When she was arrested
the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter.
The girl &apos;gave&apos; her mother a free dress once a week

Lesson 33
Out of the darkness
First listen and then answer the question:
Why was the girl in hospital?
Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain 
what had happened to her.
One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small boat 
and was caught in a storm.
Towards evening,the boat struck a rock
and the girl jumped into the sea.
Then she swam to the shore after spending the whole night in the water.
During that time she covered a distance of eight miles.
Early next morning, she saw a light ahead.
She knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs.
On arriving at the shore,
the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light she had seen.
That was all she remembered.
When she woke up a day later,she found herself in hospital.

  Everything except  the weather
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did Harrison sell his house so quickly?
My old friend, Harrison,
had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England.
He had often dreamed of retiring in England
and had planned to settle down in the country.
He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there.
Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather,
for even though it was still summer,it rained continually 
and it was often bitterly cold.
After so many years of sunshine,Harrison got a shock.
He acted as if he had never lived in England before.
In the end,it was more than he could bear.
He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country.
The dream he had had for so many years ended there.
Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.

She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her.
Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time,she was busy eating.

&apos;We mustn&apos;t buy things we don&apos;t need,&apos;I remarked suddenly.
I regretted saying it almost at once. 
&apos;You needn&apos;t have said that,&apos; my wife answered.
&apos;I needn&apos;t remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.&apos;
&apos;I find it beautiful,&apos; I said. &apos;A man can never have too many ties.&apos;

As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of Old Delhi,
we stopped at a square to have a rest.
After a time,we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets
at the other side of the square,
so we went to have a look at him.
As soon as he saw us he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins
and opened one of the baskets.
When he began to play a tune,we had our first glimpse of the snake.
It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe.
We were very much surprised
when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs.
The snake,however,continued to &apos;dance&apos; slowly.
It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!

successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time.
Though,at first,Byrd and his men
were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay below,
they soon ran into serious trouble.
At one point,it seemed certain that their plane would crash.
It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet.
Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks.
The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet.
Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away,
for there were no more mountains in sight.
The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.

Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed,

He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing
He then asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my new job in London.
In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises.
Meanwhile,my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been.
I suddenly felt very worried,but could not say anything.

First listen and then answer the question:
How did the dream end?
Tired of sleeping on the floor,
a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed.
For the first time in his life,
he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress.
Because the weather was very hot,
he carried the bed on to the roof of his house.
He slept very well for the first two nights,
but on the third night,a storm blew up.
A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof
and sent it crashing into the courtyard below.
The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground.
Although the bed was smashed to pieces,
the man was miraculously unhurt.
When he woke up,he was still on the mattress.
Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him,
the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.
After he had put it on the floor,he promptly went to sleep again.

&apos;Well,in that case,I prefer to stay on the bus,&apos;I answered.

Lesson 51
  Reward for virtue
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did Hugh&apos;s diet not work?
My friend,Hugh,has always been fat,
but things got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet.
He began his diet a week ago.
First of all,he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden.
The list included most of the things Hugh loves:
butter,potatoes,rice beer,milk,chocolate, and sweets.
Yesterday I paid him a visit.
I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever.
He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk.
It was obvious that he was very embarrassed.
When I asked him what he was doing,
he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk.
He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally.
Then he showed me the contents of the parcel
It contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!

Lesson 52
 A pretty carpet
First listen and then answer the question:
What is the writer&apos;s carpet made of?
We have just moved into a new house and I have been working
hard all morning.
I have been trying to get my new room in order.
This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books.
To make matters worse,the room is rather small,
so I have temporarily put my books on the floor.
At the moment,they cover every inch of floor space
and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room.
A short while ago,
my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs.
She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those
books on the floor.
&apos;This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen,&apos;she said.
She gazed at it for some time then added &apos;You don&apos;t need bookcases at all.
You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!&apos;

Lesson 53
    Hot snake
First listen and then answer the question:
What caused the fire?
At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California.
Since then,they have been trying to find out how the fire began
Forest fires are often caused by broken glass
or by cigarette ends which people carelessly throw away.
Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully,
but were not able to find any broken glass.
They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire.
This morning,however a firemen accidentally discovered the cause.
He noticed the remains of a snake
which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line.
In this way,he was able to solve the mystery.
The explanation wassimple but very unusual.
A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground
and then dropped it on to the wires.
The snake then wound itself round the wires.
When it did so,
it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.

After breakfast,Isent the children to school and then I went to the shops.
It was still early when I returned home
The children were at school,my husband was at work and the house was quiet.
So I decided to make some meat pies.
In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour
and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry.
At exactly that moment the telephone rang.
Nothing could have been more annoying.
I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers
and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Hellen Bates.
It took me ten minutes to persuade her to ring back later.
At last I hung up the receiver.
What a mess!
There was pastry on my fingers,on the telephone,and on the doorknobs.
I had no sooner got back to the kitchen
than the doorbell rang loud enough to wake the dead.
This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter!

Lesson 55
  Not a gold mine
First listen and then answer the question:
What did the team find?
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently.
A new machine called &apos;The Revealer&apos; has been invented
and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground.
The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where--
it is said--pirates used to hide gold.
The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.
Armed with the new machine a search party went into the cave
hoping to find buried treasure.
The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave
when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.
Very excited,the party dug a hole two feet deep.
They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless.
The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly
but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk.
In spite of this, many people are confident
that &apos;The Revealer&apos; may reveal something of value fairly soon

Lesson 56
 Faster than sound!
First listen and then answer the question:
How fast did the winning car go?
Once a year,a race is held for old cars.
A lot of cars entered for this race last year
and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began.
One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost.
The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels.
Built in 1885,it was the oldest car taking part.
After a great many loud explosions,the race began.
Many of the cars broke down on the course
and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them!
A few cars,however, completed the race.
The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour
--much faster than any of its rivals.
It sped downhill at the end of the race
and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it.
The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure.
It was very different from modern car races but no less exciting.

First listen and then answer the question:
Did the woman get what she wanted?
A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop.
Though she hesitated for a moment,
she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window.
The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed.
Glancing at her scornfully he told her that the dress was sold.
The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish
the assistant next day
She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat,
with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other.
After seeking out the rude assistant,
she asked for the same dress.
Not realizing who she was,the assistant was eager to serve her this time.
With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress.
As soon as she saw it,the woman said she did not like it.
She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everythig in the window
before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.

Lesson 58
 A blessing in  disguise?
First listen and then answer the question:
Why does the vicar refuse to cut down the tree?
The tiny village of Frinley is said to possessa &apos;cursed tree&apos;.
Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper,
the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased.
The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago
but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation.
It is said that if anyone touches the tree,he will have bad luck;
if he picks a leaf, he will die.
Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims.
The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down,but so far he has refused.
He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income,
as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it.
In spite of all that has been said,
the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk.
So far,not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!

   In or out?
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did Rex run away?
Our dog,Rex,used to sit outside our front gate and bark.
Every time he wanted to come into the garden he would bark
until someone opened the gate.
As the neighbours complained of the noise,
my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himeself in.
Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate.
However,when I was going out shopping last week,
I noticed him in the garden near the gate
This time he was barking so that someone would let him out!
Since then,he has developed another bad habit.
As soon as he opens the gate from the outside,
he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts.
Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out.
After this immediately lets himself in and begins barking again.
Yesterday my husband removed the gate
and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.

I went into her tent and she told me to sit down.
After I had given her some money,she looked into a crystal ball and said:
&apos;A relation of yours is coming to see you.
She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days.
The moment you leave this tent,you will get a big surprise.
A woman you know well will rush towards you.
She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place.That is all.&apos;
As soon as I went outside,I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky
because my wife hurried towards me.
&apos;Where have you been hiding?&apos;she asked impatiently.
&apos;Your sister will be here in less than an hour
and we must be at the station to meet her.
We are late already.&apos;

 Trouble with the  Hubble
First listen and then answer the question:
What is the special importance of a telescope in space?
The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20,1990
at a cost of over a billion dollars.
Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble.
The pictures it sent us were very disappointing
because its main mirror was faulty!
NASA is now going to put the telescope right,
so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it.
The shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble.
A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it
while the astronauts make the necessary repairs.
Of course,the Hubble is above the earth&apos;s atmosphere,
so it will soon be sending us
the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen.
The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.
By the time you read this,
the Hubble&apos;s eagle eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

Lesson 62
  After the fire
First listen and then answer the question:
What was the danger to the villages after the fire?
Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks
before they could get it under control.
A short time before,great trees had covered the countryside
for miles around.
Now,smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills.
Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction,
for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well
When the fire had at last been put out,
the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed
which would grow quickly.
The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes.
The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.
By then,however,in many places the grass had already taken root.
In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries,
patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.

 The Channel Tunnel
First listen and then answer the question:
Why was the first tunnel not completed?
In 1858,a French engineer,Aime Thome de Gamond,
arrived in England with a plan for a 21-mile tunnel under the English Channel.
He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel.
This platform would serve as a port and a railway station.
The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level.
In 1860,a better plan was put forward by an Englishman,William Low.
He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.
This would solve the problem of ventilation
for if a train entered this tunnel,it would draw in fresh air behind it.
Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun.
If,at the time,the British had not feared invasion,it would have been completed.
The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.
It was officially opened on March 7, 1994,
finally connecting Britain to the European continent.

Dressed up as Father Christmas
and accompanied by a &apos;guard of honour&apos;of six pretty girls,
he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo.
He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.
A policeman approached Jimmy and told him
he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic.
Though Jimmy agreed to go at once,Jumbo refused to move.
Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street.
The police had a difficult time,but they were most amused.
&apos;Jumbo must weigh a few tons,&apos;said a policeman afterwards
&apos;so it was fortunate that we didn&apos;t have to carry him.Of course,we should arrest him,
but as he has a good record,we shall let him off this time.&apos;

What was &apos;sweet as honey&apos; and why?
In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island,
a remote place in the South Pacific,a long way west of Samoa.
The plane wasn&apos;t too badly damaged,
but over the years the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed.
Then in 1989,twenty-six years after the crash,
the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island.
By this time,
a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing.
The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France.
Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored.
It has four RollsRoyce Merlin engines
but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt.
Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases
and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey--still in perfect condition.
A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive
and it was totally preserved in beeswax!

Haroun Tazieff,the Polish scientist,
has spent his lifetime studying active volca-noes and deep caves in all parts of the world
In 1948,he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo
to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro.
Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano
while it was erupting violently.
Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs,
he could not stay near the volcano for very long.
He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him.
It threatened to surround him completely,
but Tazieff managed to escape just in time.
He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later.
This time,he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro
so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures
Tazieff has often risked his life in this way.
He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.

The crowd began to shout,but the drunk was unaware of the danger.
The bull was busy with the matador at the time,
but it suddenly caught sight of the drunk
who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.
Apparently sensitive to criticism,
the bull forgot all about the matador and charged at the drunk.
The crowd suddenly grew quiet.The drunk however,seemed quite sure of himself.
When the bull got close to him,he clumsily stepped aside to let it pass. 
The crowd broke into cheers and the drunk bowed.
By this time,however three men had come into the ring
and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety.
Even the bull seemed to feel sorry for him,for it looked on sympathetically
until the drunk was out of the way
before once more turning its attention to the matador.

Lesson 71
  A famous clock
First listen and then answer the question:
Has Big Ben ever gone wrong?
When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben,
the famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the B.B.C.
If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834,
the great clock would never have been erected.
Big Ben takes its name rom Sir Benjamin Hall
who was responsible for the making of the clock
when the new Houses of Parliament were being built.
It is not only of immense size,but is extremely accurate as well.
Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock checked twice a day.
On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking
because microphones are connected to the clock tower.
Big Ben has rarely gone wrong.
Once,however,it failed to give the correct time.
A painter who had been working on the tower
hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!

Lesson 72
 A car called Bluebird
First listen and then answer the question:
What mistake was made?
The great racing driver,Sir Malcolm Campbell,
was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour.
He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats,Utah.
Bluebird,the car he was driving,had been specially built for him.
It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2,500-horsepower engine.
Although Campbell reached a speed ofover 304 miles per hour,
he had great difficulty in controlling the car
because a tyre burst during the first run
After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed to learn 
that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour.
However,a few days later,he was told that a mistake had been made.
His average speed had been 301 miles per hour.
Since that time, racing drivers have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour.
Following in his father&apos;s footsteps many years later Sir Malcolm&apos;s son,Donald,
also set up a world record.
Like his father,he was driving a car called Bluebird.

Lesson 73
 The record-holder
First listen and then answer the question:
Did the boy go where he wanted to?
Children who play truant from school are unimaginative.
A quiet days&apos; fishing,
or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again,
is usually as far as they get.
They have all been put to shame by a boy who,while playing truant travelled 1,600 miles.
He hitchhiked to Dover and towards evening went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep
When he woke up next morning,
he discovered that the boat had,in the meantime,travelled to Calais.
No one noticed the boy as he crept off.
From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry.
The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.
The next car the boy stopped
did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would,
but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border.
There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.
He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school

Lesson 74
Out of the limelight
First listen and then answer the question:
Why was their disguise &apos;too perfect&apos;?
An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed
and a party of famous actors and actresses got off.
Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes,
they had taken special precautions so that no one should recognize them.
But as they soon discovered,disguises can sometimes be too perfect.
&apos;This is a wonderful place for a picnic,&apos;said Gloria Gleam.
&apos;It couldn&apos;t be better,Gloria,&apos; Brinksley Meers agreed
&apos;No newspaper men,no film fans!Why don&apos;t we come more often?&apos;
Meanwhile,two other actors Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves,
had carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some trees.
When they had all made themselves comfortable,a stranger appeared.
He looked very angry &apos;Now you get out of here,all of you!&apos; he shouted.
&apos;I&apos;m sheriff here.Do you see that notice?
It says &quot;No Camping&quot; --in case you can&apos;t read!&apos;
&apos;Look,sheriff,&apos; said Rockwall,
&apos;don&apos;t be too hard on us.I&apos;m Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.&apos;
&apos;Oh,is it?&apos;said the sheriff with a sneer &quot;
&apos;Well,I&apos;m Brinksley Meers,and my other name is Gloria Gleam
Now you get out of here fast!&apos;

Lesson 75
    SOS
First listen and then answer the question:
How did the woman get help?
When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago,
it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed.
The only passengers,a young woman and her two baby daughters,were unhurt.
It was the middle of winter.Snow lay thick on the ground.
The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away.
When it grew dark,she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it,
covering them with all the clothes she could find.
During the night,it got terribly cold.
The woman kept as near as she could to the children
and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small.
Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead
and wondered how she could send a signal.
Then she had an idea She stamped out the letters &apos;SOS&apos; in the snow.
Fortunately,a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by rad- io to the nearest town
It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene
to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.

 April Fools&apos; Day
First listen and then answer the question:
What was the joke?
&apos;To end our special news bulletin,&apos;said the voice of the television announcer
&apos;we&apos;re going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria.
Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years.
Two of the leading growers Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante,
tell me that they have been expecting a splendid crop this year
and harvesting has begun earlier than usual.
Here you can see two workers who,between them,
have just finished cutting three cartl- oads of golden brown macaroni stalks.
The whole village has been working day and night
gathering and threshing this year&apos;s crop before the September rains.
On the right,you can see Mrs.Brabante herself.
She has been helping her husband for thirty years now.
Mrs.Brabante is talking to the manager of the local factory
where the crop is processed.
This last scene shows you what will happen at the end of the harvest:
the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition!
Signor Fratelli,the present champion,has won it every year since 1991.
And that ends our special bulletin for today,Thursday, April 1st.

Lesson 77
 A successful   operation
First listen and then answer the question:
Did the doctors find out how the woman died
The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C has just had an operation.
The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes.
As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy,
doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease.
The only way to do this was to operate.
The operation,which lasted for over four hours,
proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin.
The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory.
They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show:
a small wax figure of the god Duamutef.
This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy.
The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died.
They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open,
but fortunately this has not happened.
The mummy successfully survived the operation

Lesson 78
   The last one?
First listen and then answer the question:
For how long did the writer give up smoking
After reading an article entitled &apos;Cigarette Smoking and Your Health&apos;
I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves.
I smoked with concentration and pleasure
as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette.
For a whole week I did not smoke at all a
and during this time my wife suffered terribly
I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking:
a bad temper and an enormous appetite.
My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars.
They made no effort to hide their amusement
whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket.
After seven days of this I went to a party.
Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable.
When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette,
it was more than I could bear.
I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction.
My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more.
Anyway,as Brian pointed out,
it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.
He himself has done it lots of times!

    By air
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did the plane turn back?
I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy.
My parents used to live in South America
and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays.
A flight attendant would take charge of me and I never had an unpleasant experience.
I am used to travelling by air
and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened.
After taking off,we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height,
when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport.
While we were waiting to land, a flight attendant told us to keep calm
and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had touched down.
Everybody on board was worried and we were curious to find out what had happened.
Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board.
The police had been told that a bomb had been planted on the plane.
After we had landed, the plane was searched thoroughly.
Fortunately,nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again

Lesson 80
 The Crystal Palace
First listen and then answer the question:
How many people visited the Great Exhibition of 1851?
Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the 19th century was the Crystal Palace
which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851.
The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world,
for it was made of iron and glass.
It was one of the biggest buildings of all time
and a lot of people from many countries came to see it.
A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world.
There was also a great deal of machinery on display
The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth&apos;s steam hammer.
Though in those days travelling was not as easy as it is today,
steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe.
On arriving in England,they were,taken to the Crystal Palace by train.
There were six million visitors in all,
and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges.
Later,the Crystal Palace was moved to South London.
It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936

    Escape
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did the prisoner attack the driver?
When he had killed the guard,the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes.
Working rapidly in the darkness,he soon changed into the dead man&apos;s clothes.
Now,dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder,
the prisoner marched boldly up and down in front of the camp.
He could hear shouting in the camp itself.
Lights were blazing and men were running here and there:
they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped.
At that moment,a large black car with four officers inside it,
stopped at the camp gates.
The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed
When they had gone, the driver of the car came towards him
The man obviously wanted to talk.
He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue eyes.
The prisoner felt sorry for him,but there was nothing else he could do.
As the man came near the prisoner knocked him to the ground with a sharp blow.
Then,jumping into the car,he drove off as quickly as he could.

Lesson 82
 Monster or fish?
First listen and then answer the question:
What was the monster called?
Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.
Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen,
it is now known that many of these &apos;monsters&apos; which have at times been sighted
are simply strange fish.
Occasionally,unusual creatures are washed to the shore,
but they are rarely caught out at sea.
Some time ago, however,a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.
A small fishing boat
was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish
the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.
When it was eventually brought to shore,it was found to be over thirteen feet long.
It had a head like a horse big blue eyes,shining silver skin,and a bright red tail.
The fish,which has since been set to a museum
where it is being examined by a scientist,is called an oarfish.
Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man
as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

My friend,Patrick,

After the elections,Patrick went to the former Prime Minister&apos;s house.
When he asked if Mr.Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him
that since his defeat,the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.
On the following day Patrick went to the house again.
The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance,
when Patrick asked the same question.
Though a little suspicious this time the policeman gave him the same answer.
The day after,Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.
This time,the policeman lost his temper.

Busmen have decided to go on strike next week.
The strike is due to begin on Tuesday.No one knows how long it will last.
The busmen have stated that the strike will continue
until general agreement is reached about pay and working conditions.
Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week.
Many owners of private cars
are going to offer &apos;free rides&apos; to people on their way to work.
This will relieve pressure on the trains to some extent.
Meanwhile,a number of university students
have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts.
All the students are expert drivers,but before they drive any of the buses,
they will have to pass a special test.
The students are going to take the test in two days&apos; time.
Even so,people are going to find it difficult to get to work 
But so far,
the public has expressed its gratitude to the students in lettters to the Press.
Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast!

who had been water skiing for the last fifteen minutes.
Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening
when they were thrown violently into the sea.
The speedboat had struck a buoy,
but it continued to move very quickly across the water.
Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore,
when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle.
It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed.
In less than a minute,it roared past them only a few feet away.
After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could
because they knew that the boat would soon return.
They had just had enough time to swim out of danger
when the boat again completed a circle.
On this occasion,however,it had slowed down considerably.
The petrol had nearly all been used up.
Before long,the noise dropped completely
and the boat began to drift gently across the water.

I was travelling on the 8 o&apos;clock train to London,&apos;said the man.
&apos;Do you always catch such an early train? asked the inspector.
&apos;Of course I do,&apos; answered the man.&apos;I must be at work at 10 o&apos;clock.
My employer will confirm that I was there on time.&apos;
&apos;Would a later train get you to work on time?&apos;asked the inspector.
&apos;I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.&apos;
&apos;At what time did you arrive at the station?&apos;
&apos;At ten to eight.I bought a paper and waited for the train.&apos;
&apos;And you didn&apos;t notice anything unusual?&apos;
&apos;Of course not.&apos;
&apos;I suggest,&apos;said the inspector,&apos;that you are not telling the truth.
I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o&apos;clock train,
but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time.
You see,on the morning of the murder,the 8 o&apos;clock train did not run at all.
It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.&apos;

 Trapped in a mine
First listen and then answer the question:
Why is the rescue taking so long?
Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours.
If they are not brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives.
However,rescue operations are proving difficult.
If explosives are used,vibrations will cause the roof the mine to collapse.
Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine.
They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule.
If there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil,
they would have completed the job in a few hours.
As it is,they have been drilling for 16 hours and they still have a long way to go.
Meanwhile,a microphone,which was lowered into the mine two hours ago,
has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives.
Though they are running out of food and drink,
the men are cheerful and confident that they will soon get out
They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly.
If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock,
they would lose heart.

A slip of the tongue

People will do anything to see a free show--even if it is a bad one.
When the news got round
that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema
by the P.and U.Bird Seed Company,we all rushed to see it.
We had to queue for hours to get in
and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.
Unfortunately,the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.
Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed,
as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.
The only funny things we heard that evening came from the
advertiser at the beginning of the programme.
He was obviously very nervous
and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.
As soon as he opened his mouth,everyone burst out laughing.
We all know what the poor man should have said,but what he actually said was:
&apos;This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company Good ladies,evening and gentlemen!&apos;

Lesson 90
 What&apos;s for supper?
First listen and then answer the question:
What kind of fish are they?
Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain,
but as the oceans have been overfished fish has become more and more expensive.
So it comes as a surprise to learn that
giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs.
Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers,
who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water,
have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work
Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters.
The fish are not sharks or killer whales,
but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes,
sometimes as much as twelve feet in length. 
Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large:
the warm water roundthe hot oil pipes under the sea;
the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs;
the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs.
As a result,the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water.
Who eats who?

Lesson 91
Three men in a basket
First listen and then answer the question:
Where was the station&apos;s Commanding Officer?
A pilot noticed a balloon
which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force station nearby.
He informed the station at once,but no one there was able to explain the mystery. 
The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news,
because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft.
He said that someone might be spying on the station
and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object.
The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time.
He could make out three men in a basket under it
and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars.
When the balloon was over the station,the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs
Soon afterwards,the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.
The police were called in,but they could not arrest anyone,
for the basket contained two Members of Parliament
and the Commanding Officer of the station!
As the Commanding Officer explained later,
one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!

Lesson 92
 Asking for trouble
First listen and then answer the question:
Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station?
It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home.
I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell,but she was fast asleep,
so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden,put it against the wall,
and began climbing towards the bedroom window.
I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said.
&apos;I don&apos;t think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.&apos;
I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.
I immediately regretted answering in the way I did,but I said,
&apos;I enjoy cleaning windows at night.&apos;
&apos;So do I,&apos;answered the policeman in the same tone.
Excuse my interrupting you.I hate to interrupt a man when he&apos;s busy working
but would you mind coming with me to the station?&apos;
&apos;Well,I&apos;d prefer to stay here,&apos;I said. &apos;You see,I&apos;ve forgotten my key.&apos;
&apos;Your what?&apos;he called. &apos;My key,&apos; I shouted.
Fortunately,the shouting woke up my wife
who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me.

Lesson 93
   A noble gift
First listen and then answer the question:
Where was the Statue of Liberty made?
One of the most famous monuments in the world,the Statue of Liberty,
was presented to the USA in the nineteenth century by the people of France.
The great statue,which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi,
took ten years to complete.
The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework
which had been especially constructed by Eiffel.
Before it could be transported to the United States,
a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built.
The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour.
By 1884,a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris
The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America.
By the end of October 1886,the statue had been put together again
and it was officially presented to American people by Bartholdi.
Ever since then,the great monument has been a symbol of liberty
for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour
to make their homes in America.

Lesson 94
 Future champions
First listen and then answer the question:
What kind of race do the children compete in?
Experiments have proved
that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age.
At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles,
children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk.
Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water.
It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming
that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool.
A game that is very popular with these young swimmers
is the underwater tricycle race.
Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.
The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool.
Many pedal their tricycles but most of them prefer to push or drag them.
Some children can cover the whole length of the pool
without coming up for breath even once.
Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions,only time will tell.
Meanwhile,they should encourage those among us
who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.

Lesson 95
    A fantasy
First listen and then answer the question:
Why was the ambassador particularly lucky?
When the Ambassador of Escalopia returned home for lunch,his wife got a shock.
He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.
&apos;What has happened?&apos; she asked.&apos;How did your clothes get into such a mess?&apos;
&apos;A fire extinguisher my dear,&apos;answered the Ambassador drily
&quot;University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.&apos;
&apos;Good heavens!&apos; exclaimed his wife. &quot;And where were you at the time?&apos;
&apos;I was in my office as usual,&apos;answered the Ambassador.
&apos;The fire broke out in the basement.I went down immediately,of course,
and that fool,Horst, aimed a fire extinguisher at me.
He thought I was on fire.I must definitely get that fellow posted.&apos;
The Ambassador&apos;s wife went on asking questions,
when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband&apos;s hat
&apos;And how can you explain that?&apos;she asked.&apos;Oh,that,&apos;said the Ambassador.
&apos;Someone fired a shot through my office window.Accurate,don&apos;t you think?
Fortunately,I wasn&apos;t wearing it at the time.
If I had been,I would not have been able to get home for lunch.&apos;

Lesson 96
  The dead return
First listen and then answer the question:
What happens to the lanterns at the end of the festival?
A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan.
This festival is a cheerful occasion,
for on this day,the dead are said to return to their homes
and they are welcomed by the living.
As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey,
food is laid out for them.
Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house
to help the dead to find their way.
All night long,people dance and sing.
In the early morning the food that had been laid out for the dead
is thrown into a river or into the sea
as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it.
In towns that are near the sea,
the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before,
are placed into the water when the festival is over.
Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea
guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world.
This is a moving spectacle for crowds of people stand on the shore
watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.
